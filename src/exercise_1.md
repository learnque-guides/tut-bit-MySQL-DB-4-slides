# Exercise 1

The following query attempts to filter orders that were not placed on the last day of the year. It’s supposed to return the order ID, order date, customer ID, employee ID, and respective end-of-year date for each order:

```sql
SELECT orderid, orderdate, custid, empid,
  DATE_FORMAT(orderdate, '%Y-12-31') AS endofyear
FROM Orders
WHERE orderdate <> endofyear;
```

When you try to run this query, you get the error.
Explain what the problem is, and suggest a valid solution.
