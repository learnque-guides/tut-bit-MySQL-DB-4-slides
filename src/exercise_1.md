# Exercise 1

The following query attempts to filter orders that were not placed on the last day of the year. Itâ€™s supposed to return the order ID, order date, customer ID, employee ID, and respective end-of-year date for each order:

```sql
SELECT orderid, orderdate, custid, empid,
  DATE_FORMAT(orderdate, '%Y-12-31') AS endofyear
FROM Orders
WHERE orderdate <> endofyear;
```

When you try to run this query, you get the error.
Explain what the problem is, and suggest a valid solution.
